# Framework for smart grid security
An experimental framework for improving security in the context of smart grids

The proposed experimental framework aims to demonstrate how the use of blockchain technology to implement the data provenance is an efficient and effective choice to enhance the information security live a critical infrastructure such as that of smart grids, with the aim of protecting the data produced by them and in the face of the most worrying vulnerabilities. In particular, it is written to adapt to the specific use case of smart grids, a base page on blockchain called IoTProvenance origin by M. Sigwart, which agrees to the creation, modification and invalidate data records, and memories within the blockchain, and meet the main security requirements, i.e. authenticity, reliability and integrity of data.

The framework was born from the experimental thesis work, therefore it can be improved, but use it with care.
